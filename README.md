# Spam Mail Prediction Project

## Introduction
Spam Mail Prediction is a Machine Learning project that classifies emails or messages as Spam or Not Spam (Ham). It helps users filter unwanted messages automatically and improves email security and productivity.

---

## Problem Statement
Many users receive large amounts of unwanted spam emails every day. Manually checking and deleting spam messages is time-consuming and inefficient. There is a need for an automated system that can accurately detect spam emails.

---

## Proposed Solution
This project uses Machine Learning algorithms to analyze the content of email messages and predict whether they are Spam or Not Spam. A Naive Bayes classifier is used for training the model on a labeled dataset.

---

## Objectives
- To build a system that can classify messages as Spam or Not Spam.
- To reduce manual effort in filtering spam emails.
- To apply Machine Learning concepts in real-world problems.
- To improve accuracy in spam detection.

---

## Scope
This project can be used in email applications, messaging platforms, and communication systems. It can be further enhanced with advanced algorithms and real-time spam filtering features.

## Technology Stack
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

---

## Features
- Simple and easy to use
- High prediction accuracy
- User input for testing messages
- Automatic spam classification
- Machine Learning based approach

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the SMS Spam Collection Dataset which contains labeled messages as Spam and Ham.

---

## How to Run the Project
1. Place `spam_mail_prediction.ipynb` and `spam.csv` in the same folder.
2. Open the notebook file.
3. Run all the cells.
4. Enter a message when prompted to check if it is Spam or Not Spam.

---

## Output
The system displays whether the entered message is Spam Mail or Not Spam Mail.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Add a graphical user interface (GUI).
- Improve accuracy using advanced algorithms.
- Integrate with email services for real-time filtering.
- Add database support for storing results.

---

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the practical application of Machine Learning in detecting spam messages. It provides an efficient solution for managing unwanted emails and helps improve communication quality.
